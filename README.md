# javascript-p5
Learning how to code with javaScript library p5 from Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel The Coding Train.

The course is divided into seven sections, which are:
* Introduction
* Drawing
* Animation
* Interaction
* Modularity and Reusability
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Repetition and Duplication

(The Introduction section will be ignored, since its content is only for setup)

I named each file based on the section name and commited with the name of the video in question. Every code must be commented.

Just for the record, I innitiated this course during the Covid-19 quarantine and intend to finish all of it in 7~10 days (from March 27th to April 5th tops).

For each section, there will be a project synthesizing all the lessons. The projects will be numbered from 1 to 5.
