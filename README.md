# javascript-p5
Learning how to code with javaScript library p5 from Daniel Shiffman's YouTube channel, The Coding Train.

The course is divided into seven sections, which are:
* Introduction
* Drawing
* Animation
* Interaction
* Modularity and Reusability
* Object-Oriented Programming
* Repetition and Duplication

(The Introduction section will be ignored, since its content is only for setup)

I first started creating files with the name of the section and a code similar to the one Daniel uses for explanation/demonstration in the videos. I'm not doing that anymore, because some sections count with several examples/demonstration and it kind of distracts me (coding and watching at the same time is a habit I don't want to stick to). Also I want to come up with my own ideas on what to do with the subject learned.


Note to future self:
I'm doing this during the quarantine. 
Restarting from middle section 3 at may 17th and want to finish the whole playlist at june 2th.
Don't want to rush 'cause I'm doing lots of stuff and wanna have a solid learning.
